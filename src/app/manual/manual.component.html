    <h1>Space Points</h1>
    <p>
      This game is a solo drafting game: every turn you buy a card and gain its effects. You try to get as many points
      as possible after {{ INITIAL_MAX_HEALTH }} turns!
    </p>
    <h2>Screen</h2>
    <p>
      At the top of the screen you can see the current status of the game:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The turn counter</li>
      <li>The number of resources you have (money, flags, etc)</li>
      <li>The amount of weapons you have (small lasers, big lasers)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In the middle of the screen you see a list of cards from which you can buy one every turn.
    </p>
    <h2>Turn</h2>
    <p>
      Every turn you are given a choice of {{ INITIAL_NR_OF_CARDS_PER_DRAFT + 1 }} cards. One of those cards is always
      "Fire lasers". This card is free and increases your flags and money by as much as you have big lasers and small
      lasers. The other three cards can have any kind of effect. See below for a full list of all the cards.
    </p>
    <h2>Cards</h2>
    <ul>
      <li *ngFor="let card of getAllCards()">
        {{ card.title }} ({{card.cost}} money): {{ card.description }}.
      </li>
    </ul>
